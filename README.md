# Keylogger

Keylogging is a way to spy on a computer user. It’s generally used to gain access to passwords and other confidential information through fraud. It records every keystroke made on your computer.

Just like a hidden surveillance camera that tracks all your actions. A keylogger is a type of software that records keys as you strike them on your keyboard. Keystroke loggers arrive just as any other malware and are hard to discover if you don’t know what to look for.
